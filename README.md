Inspired by Samson Zhang's video, [Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH (no Tensorflow/Pytorch, just numpy & math)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&t=6s).

I made it my goal to inflict as much self-harm as possible in the name of learning Rust, so the only dependency of this project is the `rand` crate.
